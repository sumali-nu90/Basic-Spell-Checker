Primetive peoples often hesitate to consume the initial harvest of a crop until a specific ritual has been conducted, ensuring its safety and religious acceptability. This reluctnce stems from their belief that the first-fruits either belong to or embody a divine entity. Consequently, if an individual or animal is observed boldly taking the sacred first-fruits, they are naturlaly perceived as the actual divinity manifesting in human or animal form and claiming what is rightfully theirs.
